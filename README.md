## Rebooting the Web of Trust VI: Santa Barbara (March 2018)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT5, the sixth Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which is to run in Santa Barbara, California, on March 6th to 8th, 2018. The goal of the workshop was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the future.

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

This should be uploaded to [Topics & Advance Readings directory](topics-and-advance-readings).
