## Abstract

The Veres One Project envisions a world where people and organizations
control their identifiers and their identity data. The Veres One
Blockchain is the worlds first public, permissionless, fit-for-purpose
blockchain optimized for identity on the Web.

## Vision

The Vision of the Veres One Project is to enable all people and
organizations in the world to

1. create and own their online identifiers, and

2. control their identity data and with whom they share that data.

Achieving this vision will enable a Web where:

* Our identity information and identifiers are owned and controlled by
each of us.

* We can more strongly prove key attributes about our digital personas,
reducing fraud.

* Data can be bound to identifiers under our control instead of only to
websites, or stuck on paper in file cabinets, improving data portability.

* Privacy can be enhanced by choosing when and with whom our information
is shared.

* Data sharing can be more easily reduced to the minimum required for a
given interaction.

This vision is shared among a large community of people working within
global organizations such as the Internet Identity Workshop, World Wide
Web Consortium, Internet Engineering Task Force, United Nations ID2020,
and the Rebooting the Web of Trust project. Veres One is a realization of
this Vision and we are eternally thankful to the communities that helped
shape this project from the very beginning.
