## Abstract

The term DID Auth has been used in different ways and is currently not
well-defined. We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an identity owner,
with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices,
and other agents, cryptographically proves to a relying party that they
are the subject of a DID. This could take place using a number of
different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the
ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels, and
to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, verifiable
credentials, and capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and out of
scope for this document. This specification defines the scope of DID Auth,
supported protocols and flows, the use of components of the DID documents
which are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges
and responses.
