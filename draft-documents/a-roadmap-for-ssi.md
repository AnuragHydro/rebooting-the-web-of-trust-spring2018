## Abstract
This document summarizes the market strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) industry. It proposes to create a persistent cross-functional and cross-company team to develop the SSI market. It lists key stakeholders who can open market doors for the SSI industry, and who would benefit from better understanding of the SSI market. Its first project will be an SSI application market roadmap, to show the technical prerequisites, market enablers, risks, revenues, and costs of different SSI applications on a reasonable timeline. A roadmap will help SSI leaders, standards bodies, developers, academics, media, and investors focus on important work, and accelerate the SSI market. Further projects will include go-to-market materials for developers, market explainers, frequently asked questions, market glossaries, and market research.

## Audience
We wrote this paper to find more people who see a healthy SSI market as essential to their own success. By working with us, you will grow the overall SSI market, meet the major SSI market participants, and advance your own ambitions. Please join us!

# 1 SSI Industry Analysis
This section describes the state of the SSI industry, as of 7 April 2018. We can gain a broad understanding of the maturity and vulnerability of our industry by listing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis).

### Strengths
* SSI networks provide affordability, scalability, reliability, trustability, privacy, security, and portability superior to traditional centralized and siloed identity networks;
* For decades, identity leaders have avoided partisanship and collaborated on identity fundamentals and standards;
* Our community has largely completed the SSI technical infrastructure to support SSI applications; and
* There are several operational and competing SSI distributed identity networks and wallets in beta.

### Weaknesses

Our own complacency could derail or delay SSI adoption.

* Self-sovereign identity concepts can be confusing, especially when we lead with technology and not societal benefits
* We do not discuss deployment schedules for SSI networks and APIs, so many application developers refrain from investing effort;
* We do not broadly discuss expected costs for DIDs and SSI services, which creates financial risk for startups;
* We provide no SSI reference applications and libraries, from which developers could produce compelling applications;
* We don't list SSI network and wallet vendors, and so application developers worry that they will be locked in;
* Our narrow focus on technical and philosophical exploration is distracting us, and delaying the societal and individual benefits of SSI. 
* Our individual non-specific identity concerns—such as whether biometric data might enable despotic states to track our movements—distract us from solving clear and present dangers, such as putting development work toward eliminating non-state-originated financial, identity, and privacy theft (which will actually help us better understand and address the challenges of despotic states);

### Opportunities

Society is turning a corner in demanding better identity solutions:

1. Fear of identity hacks and theft are now pervasive,
3. Privately-maintained identity systems have exposed businesses and governments to hacking, leaks, and lawsuits,
4. Foreign enemies have destabilized nations through election and infrastructure hacking,
5. Malware-borne DDS attacks have damaged individual companies and degraded the internet, and
6. Social media and advertisers have enabled private data misuse (sometimes unintentionally).

Inexpensive SSI-based solutions can resolve each of these problems. If we direct some of our attention to expanding the SSI market, we can likely gain rapid traction.

### Threats

Despite the many advantages of SSI, competitive threats that could derail or significantly delay SSI adoption.

* Key customers could adopt inferior non-SSI alternatives;
* Due to high switching cost, a poor identity decision by a customer will take years and cash to correct;
* Poor government agency decisions are worse: their low-agility means their bad technology decisions affect everyone for decades. If government agencies don't participate in distributed identity networks—for licenses, passports and national identity—it will degrade citizen security, financial tracability, and information verifiability for a long time;
* Standards bodies could produce standards incompatible with SSI. A specific concern is the mDL (mobile drivers license) standard being developed by the [ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/SG 1 working group](https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html);

False assumptions about SSI are rife:

* Some believe blockchain solutions store personally identifiable information (PII) on the distributed ledger.
* Some believe that participation in SSI networks is involuntary,
* Some believe that a decentralized ID could "*never be turned off or blocked*” due to the immutability of the distributed ledgers that underlie decentralized applications.
* Some believe it will be impossible to prevent anyone from publishing anything they want about you, without the standard societal repercussions (libel, etc.), and that ledger immutability negative reviews become part of an indelible permanent record.
* Few people understand the privacy benefits of *Selective Disclosure* (or the Principle of Minimum Disclosure), and how those are built into many SSI network implementations.

Most of these threats can be disarmed by informing key influencers.	
## Industry Goals

Presently, the SSI industry operates by loose consensus via the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) and the Rebooting Web of Trust (RWOT) conferences, and through the W3C Verified Claims and Distributed Identity communities and working groups.

* One million public (non-pseudonymous) DIDs issued by March 2019
* Formalized plans by year-end 2018 for the foundational SSI specifications
	* W3C DID
	* W3C VC
	* Oasis DKMS
* The release of a handful of reference applications that provide a down payment on the promise of decentralized identity.

# 2 Self-Sovereign Identity Group Charter

This section describes the mission, stakeholders, goals, and initial organizational structure of the proposed [Self-Sovereign Identity Group](http://selfsovereign.id).

## Mission
We improve social stability, economic productivity, and individual freedom by promoting broad use of self-sovereign identity. 

## Stakeholders
Our market development efforts will target these stakeholders.

| Role                                 | Benefit                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical leaders                    | Focus innovation on market enabling technology            |
| Standards participants               | Develop standards that promote high usage                 |
| Media                                | Develop more compelling, meaningful, and accurate stories |
| Developers                           | Create applications and services for rapid adoption       |
| Businesses, Governments, Non-profits | Develop early customers and adoption                      |
| Venture capitalists                  | Make better decisions to reduce risk and increase IRR     |
| Academics                            | Target hot research opportunities                         |

## Membership

Members in this organization must contribute to content development and distribution, stakeholder engagement and recruiting. In return, members' companies (or the individual if they are independent) will be highlighted on our web site and promotional materials. Individual members will learn an enormous amount about the SSI market, ICO funding strategies, identity stakeholders, standards organizations, and marketing. Members will meet many industry luminaries and through them gain career opportunities. Finally, to the extent possible we want members to have autonomy, by providing measurable goals and allowing them to achieve those goals as they see fit (within reason).

We expect the organization to ultimately self-organize to maximize market expansion. Initially, a single **Product Owner** may prioritize work, and a **Scrum Master** may be assigned to facilitate communication and work, manage the workflow and seek timely results.

These focus areas will likely dominate our activities.

* **Content**: Create the informational content (presentation, videos, etc) suitable for stakeholders
* **Portal**: Create and maintain the organization's website
* **Communications**: Propagate SSI messaging to passive stakeholders
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage key standards and open source workgroups in a two-way dialog
* **Management**: Recruit members, prioritize value, facilitate effort

## Approach
Frame an approach that will place concentrated focus on key success factors and deliverables. We will touch on the necessity for toolkits, minimum viable environments (MVE), and interoperable end-to-end exemplars. Specifically, we suggest that attention must be placed on the following goals:

* Outline a better approach for communicating a crisp, cohesive and comprehensive vision of the core benefits of SSI.
* Justify the importance of streamlining the developer experience through tools that improve time to value and assist in the development of compelling applications.
* Shift the focus from longer term ad-hoc brainstorming towards a formal initiative to develop a set of minimum viable reference applications.
* Help find the WOW (the balance between low hanging fruit scenarios and instantly graspable killer app features) that inspires hope and stimulates media interest and viral propagation so that we can win the hearts and minds of a critical mass of stakeholders.

To address these goals, the community needs to crystalize a cohesive maturation roadmap (plan) that outlines initiatives which are measurable via key performance indicators. For example:

## Starting Content

### Wallet Vendors

* Solving the Wallet distribution problem
	* Who are the wallet makers 
	* How wallets will be [interoperable and secure](http://www.links.org/files/nspw36.pdf) 

### Debunking Myths

The urgency for a roadmap may be justified best by listening to naysayers. A poor communication plan gives rise to myths that need to be discredited. Here are a few examples of myths already circulating in the media and amongst analysts:

* For example some people believe that blockchain identity solutions store personally identifiable information (PII) on the distributed ledger. This is utterly false. The SSI initiative not only advocates against such poor practices, the community has established several principles including that of *portability* which addresses this issue. A globally unique [decentralized identifier](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#dfn-did) (DID), which is compliant with internet standard [Universally Unique Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (UUIDs), is used to establish a non-correlatable unique ID. While this DID may be stored on a blockchain and used as mechanism for public key exchange, the actual PII associated with an individual is never placed on a public ledger. This DID is used by an SSI solution to deliver public keys that can be used to verify identity realted credentials that are exchanged privately between willing participants at the edges of the network.
* Another common misconception about the decentralized identity concept is that participation in the system is somehow involuntary. Additionally, it has been said, erroneously, that a decentralized ID could "*never be turned off or blocked*” due to the immutability of the distributed ledgers that underlie decentralized applications. And finally, that it will be impossible to prevent anyone from publishing anything they want about you, and that the immutability of the ledger means a negative review would be part of an indelible permanent record. Implying that once you are associated with a digital key in a world of pertinent memory, anyone can choose to add any information they want about you to the public record that could never be changed.  These misconceptions could not be farther from the truth. The DID specification states clearly that the publishing of any user’s decentralized ID is explicitly controlled and administered by the user/owner. The proposed specification for Verifiable Credentials states plainly that claims are revocable, expirable, and that the policies of both the issuer and holder must be adhered to. It’s assumed that the normal policy for a holder is to approve every credential before acceptance. This means that a competitor, who would not be trusted to make a claim about your business, could not append a negative claim about your business without your explicit approval. This is because both the issuer and holder both have the ability to revoke any claim. 
* Some also misunderstand the concepts behind *Selective Disclosure* (or the Principle of Minimum Disclosure). The true intent here is that a system should follow a minimal disclosure approach that could help with compliance with regulations like HIPAA in the US and GDPR in the EU. This means that users can be in control of private data that they don’t even realize they have, enabling a level of control over personally identifiable data and enabling data privacy at a level heretofore never seen before. 


### Be Proactive 
The reality is that there will always be naysayers and alternatives to our SSI vision. However, it is our responsibility to proactively defend our cause. It is not in our best interest to spend wasteful energy debating. Instead we should focus our attention on awareness and education through positive communications and live exemplars. To be proactive we need a plan.

## Manifesting some WOWs

Another requirement for success is to create a design process that would lead to a sustainable flow of compelling technologies that provide a “wow” factor, that can form a pipeline of compelling functionality to fortify the value proposition for decentralized identity. An initial set of projects and ideas for “wow prototypes” include:

1. **Community Badges Toolkit**: Produce a Starter Kit for any small or large community to begin to issue verifiable credentials in the form of [OpenBadges](https://openbadges.org). Such a toolkit would be a perfect *Getting Started* toolkit for a Go-to-Market (GTM) package of resources.  

	>NOTE:  The final paper submitted by the [Open Badges are Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018) RWOT Workgroup is suppose to produce a working prototype that can be used to seed this toolkit.

2. **Industry Demos**: Develop a number of vertical industry references. For example:
	* FinTech: A demo of the [CULedger](http://culedger.com) CUID Trust Framework that uses the Hyperledger Indy framework. 
	* Travel and Transportation: A [Dapps](https://coinsutra.com/dapps-decentralized-applications/) that implements one or more  concepts outlined in the [World Economic Forum’s Known Traveler Report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-known-traveller-unlocking-the-potential-of-digital-identity-for-secure-and-seamless-travel). 
	
3. **Other Interesting Concepts**: There are a number of other potential reference applications that could be interesting to develop and deploy. 
	* *SuperSignOn*, a decentralized authentication system based on the DID-Auth specification. 
	* *GitHub Authentication* using Verifiable Credentials. 
	* *ICO-LegalAssist* which would use Verifiable Claims as a basis for attestations by attorneys in ICOs. 
	* *IDESG’s IDEF assessment* [tool for receiving badges](https://www.idefregistry.org/)

## Deliverables
A project roadmap should produce the following non-exhaustive list of artifacts:

* Creation of the Roadmap Tribe 
	* Criteria for Success: Goals for the Roadmap Tribe
	* Members and Roles
	* Published Plan/Schedule
* Community Information Portal (i.e.: ssi.org)
	* Go-to-Market (GTM) Resources
		* MythBusters: SSI/VC FAQ Sheet
		* Glossary
		* Sample Presentations
		* Videos
		* Access to subject matter experts
	* WOW Factor: Community Badges Toolkit
	* Dashboard tracking success metrics
	* Best practices for businesses to create a SSI strategy

## Next Steps

* Finalize RWOT paper (this document) as a catalyst for a roadmap.
* Get Organized
	* Duanne and Claire discuss project management
		* Setup tools (i.e. Trello)
		* Schedule cadence (scrum) call
		* Review and refine tribe structure 
	* Establish initial plan/schedule (for standards, communications media kits and GTM materials), that includes the meeting schedule (which will be a minimal time standup meeting once a week, online)
		* Work with Joe to figure out where a SSI.org portal is  organizationally hosted (CCG, RWOT?)
		* Develop a comprehensive glossary of SSI/VC terms
