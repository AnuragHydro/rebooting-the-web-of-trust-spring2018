# SSI Principle #7 Interoperability - getting to mass adoption


> Identities should be as widely usable as possible. Identities are of little value if they only work in limited niches. The goal of a 21st-century digital identity system is to make identity information widely available, crossing international boundaries to create global identities, without losing user control. Thanks to persistence and autonomy these widely available identities can then become continually available.

Today there are too many fragmented identity silos starting from a simple contact database, social networks, user directories, wallets, password managers, CRM /CIAM systems, HRMs, social and various cloud services. This adds immense friction in user experiences, adoption and security.

Further, having Sybil-resistant Identities mapped to real people is near impossible.

## Digital Identities is now a full-fledged Global War Front
With Blockchain now becoming the web of transactions requires everyone to have a private key. Allowing anonymous private keys basically sets us back a few decades of what the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was able to accomplish in its fight against Money laundering. Bill Gates has put it that its killing people in a "fairly direct way". 

Further cybercrime is going to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021. 

## The real question are
* Are we willing to give up anonymity and embrace privacy while we accept universal persistent identifiers that hold the world accountable? 
* How far can the self-sovereign identities save privacy, stop external correlation without removing accountability?
* Interoperatibility across platforms and entities must have multiple DIDs or a unqiue contact ID per relatinship is better?

### The top use cases for identities begin with
1.	Contacts
2.	Social networks
3.	Access management (IAM industry)
4.	Blockchain (wallets)
5.	AML / KYC


# Proposal for seamless interoperatibility & mass adoption
The proposal draws upon a lot of work already accomplished in previous workshops of RWOT and proposes SPKI partly based on MSISDNs.

1.	**Contacts platform** - A network of self-sovereign identities including directories with SPKI. The identities use the globally unique mobile numbers as handles like a domain name system for easy reference.
2.	**DPKI and ERC725** for managing the asymmetric keys and recovery.
3.	**Proof-of-life** - Using Social graphs and live human conversations with cryptographic signing. Similar to live human validation used during kidnappings.
4.	**Shared contact directories** exposed as LDAP for authentication, authorization and context.
5.	**Contact IDs** to prevent external correlation (while having persistent identifier in the Distributed Ledger or Identity hub).
6.	_**Cryptographic KYC**_ â€“ capture SSL certificate along with web page as a hash on blockchain.
